<CourseCard id="SIOC290S" shortName="SIOC 290S" longName="Climate Math and Science" units="6" url="/CSP#SIOC290S">
	<p>The course will introduce key physical and biogeochemical concepts needed to understand the Earth’s climate system. The overview will provide a foundation for examining the physical evidence of climate change. Mathematical methods will be presented to reinforce the scientific concepts. Students will complete group papers and presentations and lead discussions on assigned readings. <CourseLink id={848} href="/CSP#SIOC290S">SIOC 290S</CourseLink> is a required course in the curriculum of the master of advanced studies in climate science and policy. Letter grades only.</p>

<CourseCard id="SIOC291S" shortName="SIOC 291S" longName="Introduction to Climate Policy" units="6" url="/CSP#SIOC291S">
	<p>The course will focus on policy solutions to climate change and introduce key topics in state, national, and international environmental law and policy. The energy system as well as energy policy will be examined, providing an essential foundation for understanding California’s renewable energy policy goals and how we may get there. Students will complete group papers and presentations and lead discussions on assigned readings. This course will include a one-week field trip. Letter grades only.</p>

<CourseCard id="SIOC293" shortName="SIOC 293" longName="Ocean-Atmosphere Processes and Climate Variability" units="4" url="/CSP#SIOC293">
	<p>We will examine the general structure of the ocean and atmosphere and consider processes and interactions that contribute to climate variability. We will describe dominant climate modes of variability, such as ENSO, and evaluate processes driving climate changes on longer timescales, such as ice ages and deglaciation. Finally, we will explore how climate system processes and feedbacks modulate the impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and how they may be impacted in a warming climate.</p>

	<p>Prerequisites: <CourseLink id={848} href="/CSP#SIOC290S">SIOC 290S</CourseLink> and graduate standing or consent of instructor.</p>
