<CourseCard id="ANSC193GS" shortName="ANSC 193GS" longName="Human Rights and Environmental Justice" units="4" url="/ANTH#ANSC193GS">
	<p>In this course, we will examine the dominant human rights framework to think about one issue that has escaped its purview: environmental justice. If we all share a common planet, is there a universal right to a clean environment? Why are the effects of pollution and climate change unequally distributed among the world’s peoples? Can human rights norms serve as effective tools to fight the unequal effects of climate change and contamination? Program or materials fees may apply.</p>

Ultimately, our aim will be to critically rethink all three of the title terms—language, migration, and borders—in tandem.</p>
