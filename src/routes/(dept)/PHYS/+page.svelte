<h2>Lower Division</h2>
<p class="note">The PHYS 1 sequence is calculus based and is primarily intended for biology.
The PHYS 2 sequence is calculus based and is intended for physical science majors and engineering majors and those biological science majors with strong mathematical aptitude as it uses advanced calculus.
The PHYS 4 sequence is calculus based and provides a solid foundation for the core upper-division physics program. The PHYS 4 sequence is required for all physics majors, capped applicants, and students pursuing enrollment in core upper-division physics (i.e., courses in the PHYS 100, 105, 110, 120, 130, and 140 series).
