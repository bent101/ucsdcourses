From this starting point there will be two parallel and interdependent lines of work: data extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL), and statistical analysis and model building. The ultimate goal will be to present a processing pipeline which transforms the raw data into more usable forms and models which separates between the predictable and the unpredictable aspects of the underlying system.
