From this starting point there will be two parallel and interdependent lines of work: data extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL), and statistical analysis and model building. The ultimate goal will be to present a processing pipeline which transforms the raw data into more usable forms and models which separates between the predictable and the unpredictable aspects of the underlying system. Examples of previous capstone projects can be found here.</p>
