<p class="note">Linguistics Language Program Office, 3101 Applied Physics and Mathematics Building, Muir College
Students are placed in foreign language courses based on prior preparation and, for French, German, Italian, and Spanish, on the results of a placement test. Information on taking the placement exam is available at http://ling.ucsd.edu/language/placement-test.html or at the Linguistics Language Program Office (3101 Applied Physics and Mathematics Building). For placement in Arabic, American Sign Language, or Portuguese contact the Linguistics Language Program Office (3101 Applied Physics and Mathematics Building).
Conversation sections (Linguistics 1A-1B-1C-1D) consist of small tutorial meetings, plus reading and assigned laboratory work. Analysis sections (Linguistics 1AX-1BX-1CX-1DX) consist of presentation and practice of grammatical structures, discussion sections, assigned laboratory work, and outside reading. Each course in the 1A-1B-1C-1D series must be taken concurrently with the corresponding course in the 1AX-1BX-1CX-1DX series.
Heritage Language courses are offered in Arabic, Armenian, Cantonese, Filipino, Hindi, Korean, Persian, and Vietnamese. These courses are designed for students with a background in the language who want to improve their oral and written expression.
Linguistics 11 courses are self-instructional: intended for reading the language for scholarly purposes. They are particularly aimed at graduate students preparing to fulfill French or German reading requirements.
Linguistics 19 courses, offered in more than sixty languages, are designed for self-instructional study at an introductory level. Students may enroll for two or four units of credit. For some languages, depending on the availability of suitable materials, the course may be repeated for credit.</p>

<h3>Heritage Language Program</h3>
<p class="note">A “heritage” language is a language, typically spoken in the home, to which individuals are exposed during childhood. These heritage language speakers may learn to understand and speak this language to some degree but are usually more comfortable speaking the dominant language (e.g., English). The idea behind the department’s innovative Heritage Language Program is that heritage language students have a set of skills, competencies, and needs that are distinct from those of both native speakers learning to read and write the language for the first time, and also nonnative learners who may study it as a foreign language during adulthood. These students therefore require a different type of language instruction, one that builds on and enhances the linguistic skills they already possess and amplifies their cultural competence and literacy. The Heritage Language Program allows students to work toward developing higher levels of proficiency in order to pursue personal and professional goals.</p>
