<h2>Chinese Language Acquisition Courses</h2>
<p class="note">The Chinese language program offers Mandarin Chinese language acquisition courses in yearlong sequences that begin in the fall quarter. Students interested in enrolling in Chinese courses must first do a placement interview to determine the most appropriate course and then will be authorized to enroll in that course. Contact the program at chinesestudies@ucsd.edu for more information.
Chinese language courses are divided into three tracks based on student’s familiarity with the language. N track is for students with no Chinese language background; M track is for students with some speaking but not writing proficiency in Mandarin; and D track is for students with some proficiency in a Chinese language other than Mandarin. M and D tracks converge during the second year of Chinese language acquisition courses.</p>
